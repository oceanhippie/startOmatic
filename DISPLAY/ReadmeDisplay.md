This folder contains the Code for the DISPLAY

It not necessary to have or the Wirelss remote, you can operate it localy

I have not tested this without wireless hardware (I doubt it will run without a Lora Radio)
It is not necessary to have the LCD diplay (this code will run fine without it)
It is not necessary to have a relay on Pin 40 for a Horn (it will run fine without it)
